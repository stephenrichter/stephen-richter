# Stephen Richter

##### hi, i'm stephen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack web developer from Victoria, Canada. I help businesses achieve success through design-thinking and digital business strategy.

Iâ€™m super passionate about design, development, and business. From a technical standpoint, I spend most of my time working in Flutter, HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, and Adobe Creative Suite.

I graduated from Camosun College where I obtained my Bachelor of Business Admin in marketing and communications. My talent is in digital business strategy (I really know how technology and business work best together).

When not designing or coding, I love to spend my time with my beautiful wife Caleigh and daughter Harper.
