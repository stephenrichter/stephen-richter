# A 5-step guide to managing your money and mind

Most of us go through life without fully understanding our own financial situation. How much money do I have at any given time? How much should I be saving? And where does it all go?!

This kind of thinking is like going on a road trip without a map, and without knowing how much gas you have before you leave.

At the same time, the thought of personal finance and discussing ‚Äúnet worth‚Äù and budgeting may have your stomach turning. Don‚Äôt worry..

In this guide, we‚Äôre going to break it down and simplify things. And we‚Äôre going to start in the most impactful place when it comes to money.. your mind.

## 1. Mindset

Money and finance shouldn‚Äôt be a dirty word that we only speak about behind closed doors. Chances are, the less your family talked about money while you were growing up, the less likely you are to be financially literate - unless you took it upon yourself to learn about money.

So as we begin to unravel our financial position, as with most things in life, let‚Äôs not judge others or ourselves. We all want different things. I learned this one day when I looked at all the cars on the road and thought to myself..

Why would anyone drive anything other than a mid-price, reliable SUV or 4-door truck? It has room for friends and family, space to store whatever you need in the back, and it can go pretty much anywhere. So why drive anything else?

Because we all want different things! We all have different values, different hobbies, different perspectives on life (and on vehicles). Some of us don‚Äôt even want a vehicle, we‚Äôre perfectly happy riding the bus, biking, or walking to get around (and kudos to you, you healthy, environmentally-conscious son of a bitch).

Vision

Okay, here‚Äôs the fun part‚Ä¶

Find an evening this week and sit down with a laptop or pen and paper, and start dreaming. Explore what you want your life to look like in 3, 5, 10 years. Where are you living? Where are you working? What are you doing in your spare time? What vehicles do you own?

Are you travelling? Do you own a trailer or a vacation property, or are you taking trips to a local ski resort or shooting tequila down in Mexico?

Write down a few bullet points about the life you envision for yourself. It can be as grand or as humble and straightforward as you want.

When you‚Äôve dreamed all you can dream, let‚Äôs start bringing things back to reality.

## 2. Net Worth

Before we can realize any of our dreams and goals for the future, we need to assess where we‚Äôre at today. We do this by adding up all the things we own, and subtracting all the things we owe. This is called our net worth.

Ugh.. but reality sucks. Why do we even have to do this?

Well, normally if you want to go somewhere you first take stock of what you have. What kind of sociopath goes camping without first checking their backpack or totes for supplies? Exactly.

You‚Äôre about to go somewhere and you first need to know where you‚Äôre at today.

This doesn‚Äôt take long. Open up a Google Sheet, and in one column, write down all the things you own worth a decent amount of money (assets). Bank accounts, vehicles, a house, and any investments you may have.

Next, underneath those items, write down all the things you owe (liabilities). A mortgage, car loans, student loans, Visa cards or a line of credit.

Finally, in the column to the right, punch in how much all these assets and liabilities are worth today. Then add them each up with a quick =SUM() and bingo, bango, bongo, you‚Äôve got a simple calculation for your current net worth (assets - liabilities).

Don‚Äôt worry if it‚Äôs lower than you expected, or even if it‚Äôs negative at the moment. Throw the date at the top of the column. What‚Äôs more important than the number, is what it will be next month, next year, etc.

## 3. Revenue & Expenses

Alright, here comes the scary part, and the part that requires a little more work. Most of us completely ignore it for one of these reasons, or both. We need to get an accurate picture of our money. Where does it come from? Where does it go?

Now, there are a number of different ways to track your spending. However, the one we find by far most effective is the good, old fashioned spreadsheet.

And hey, if you made it through Part 2 you already have one. Just fire up another tab on that sucker, and off we go.

All our spending happens in either our TD Chequing Account or on our TD Visa Cards. So, once a month we log in to TD EasyWeb online and download our statements to Excel or CSV, and then put them into our Google Sheet.

We then add an extra column at the end and go line by line through each item, labeling it into a category of our choice (i.e. Beauty, Clothes, Entertainment, Gas, Groceries, etc.).

Have voices been raised? Have tears been shed? Yes.
Did we get an accurate picture of our spending habits? We sure did.

At first, you may feel embarrassed. How the hell do I actually spend that much on (insert category here)? Let me be honest. You‚Äôre not alone. Everyone has categories or items they spend more on than they would like others to know.

Who fucking cares? The important part is that you know what you want in your life (vision) and you now know what you are spending your money on.

And guess what? We all want different things. The real question is, does your spending align with your vision? If not, you‚Äôve got a few options..

Change your vision
Change your income
Change your spending

It‚Äôs really that simple. You dream of travelling to a different country every year but you're eating out and spending a ton on clothes? You‚Äôve got options.

Personally, I like the vision for my life. So the most realistic options for me are changes to my income and spending.

Can I work a few side jobs this month to bump my income a bit? Can I spend a little less on groceries or drink less beer next month? Holy shit, I think we‚Äôre budgeting.

## 4. Budget & Savings

Why do we need a budget? Well, I think we‚Äôve already answered that. The wonderful vision for our life doesn‚Äôt really align with what we‚Äôre spending our money on monthly.

Do we really need a budget? That depends. If you‚Äôve already got some good self-discipline, you may know the changes you need to make to your finances and your mindset, and you‚Äôre good to go.

However, a budget will help if you need to be a little more strict with yourself. This is where all the ‚Äúlife hacks‚Äù can come in as well. Can you refinance some of your loans? Can you do Sunday meal prep and save money on food and groceries? Maybe you change your phone or internet provider and benefit from a new package deal?

## 5. Savings

Remember the piggy bank that grandma gave you? Well, whether you had one or not, you get the gist. As a kid, you‚Äôd add a couple quarters here and there instead of getting a slushy, maybe earn a dollar from the tooth fairy if she was fancy.

You‚Äôd save your money and when you had enough for the doll house or lego set you‚Äôd smash that ham open and go spend your cash. Wait.. let‚Äôs rephrase..

You‚Äôd set a vision for what you wanted in life. You prioritized and saved any income you made. And after a little while you bought it.

Well, what happened?! Banks, credit cards, student loans, and the realities of life all introduce complexity by disguising the amount of money we actually have and distracting us from our vision and financial goals.

However, if you‚Äôve followed this guide up until now, you should have a way of cutting through the complexity and also a clear picture of your financial situation. You know your vision, your net worth, and your revenue and expenses.

The final piece to tie this altogether is to outline your savings plan so that you can begin working towards your vision and increasing your net worth. Two great ways to do this are to track your own savings and by working with a financial advisor.

Here is a spreadsheet we use to track our own savings. Each pay cheque we receive, we immediately take a % off for both living expenses (mortgage, utilities, food) as well as savings (TFSA, RRSPs). The amount leftover after savings and expenses is called discretionary income.

This is extra money, we are free to spend however we like. Luckily, as we‚Äôve already outlined our priorities, we know what we‚Äôd like to spend this money on. So, we enter this amount into the spreadsheet and it will calculate where we should put that money based on our own priorities and goals.

## Summary

Congratulations! You made it through all the exciting and boring parts of personal finances! Hopefully now you feel like you have a better understanding of the money you work hard for, and confident that you are spending it in a way that aligns with your life goals.

It‚Äôs a good idea to check back and review your financial situation about once per month. Here‚Äôs a quick recap of the steps involved:

Review your vision and financial and life goals
Punch in your current assets and debts and calculate your net worth
Export your bank statements and import them into your spreadsheet to calculate your income and expenses
Review your budget to understand where your money is being spent
Prioritize the big ticket items from your vision that require savings

And remember, let‚Äôs continue to discuss money (without judgement) so that it doesn‚Äôt become a scary thing that controls us. Instead, let‚Äôs set a vision and achieve it with patience and long-term planning.

If you have questions, I‚Äôm happy to answer them. It also may be a good time to look into working with a financial advisor. Best of luck in your financial journey!
