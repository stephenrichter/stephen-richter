I have a confession... 🙈

I'm a **knowledge hoarder**. At least I used to be.

When the internet throws valuable content my way I save, bookmark, and pin every bit of it.

I would tell myself "I'm saving it for later".

Saving it for a day (or weekend) when I have "a bunch of time" to digest and apply the information. Until then, I must keep it in a safe, safe place to be sure I never miss out.

Reality is much different 😒

I save hundreds (maybe thousands) of pieces of content every year, and I probably consume and apply less than 5% of it.

I often forget it even exists and double my effort researching things I've already learned.

Once a year - usually in January - I go through and delete all these "old bookmarks" that were so valuable but I no longer need or understand why I saved, in an effort to clean up and organize my digital life.

And then it begins again. Repeat process.

**Does this sound familiar?**

The good news is it doesn't have to be this way.

I recently stumbled across [Tiago Forte's PARA system](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) for organization and it's literally changed my digital life 🤯 - from the way I capture information to the way I begin or work on my projects.

### What is PARA?
PARA is a system or method for organizing digital information in a way that is simple and actionable.

It is an acronym for 4 main categories: **Projects**, **Areas**, **Resources**, and **Archives**.

A main goal of the system is to increase the frequency and actionability of digital info, so that is can easily be recalled when needed for increased productivity and creativity.

We organize content by the most actionable (Projects) to the least actionable (Archives).

#### ✅ 1. Projects
Projects are short term efforts in your work or life that you're currently working on.

They are connected to a specific goal and have a completion deadline.

#### 🔭 2. Areas
Areas are longer term responsibilities that you wish to manage over time.

They are ongoing activities that have no specific deadline, and are **personally relevant** info.

#### 📚 3. Resources
Resources are topics or interests that may be useful to you in the future.

They may be organized by hobby, interest, and are **generally useful** info.

#### 🗃️ 4. Archives
The Archive section is for any inactive or completed items that have been moved from the other 3 categories.

These items remain searchable and can be moved back if they are needed later.

### 🏁 Get started using PARA
The PARA system is lightweight, and easy get set up.

First choose an app that you use frequently to write notes and capture content 📝

> Avoid using "one app to rule them all" and instead replicate your PARA system across any of the main apps you use (i.e. Apple Notes, Obsidian, Chrome Bookmarks, etc.)

Now that you have chosen an app as a starting point, you can follow these **3 simple steps**:

1. Set up a folder for each of the 4 categories: "Projects", "Areas", "Resources", "Archives"
2. Move existing content into files or folders underneath the 4 main categories as defined above
3. Create new files and folders only if and when you need them (a.k.a. just-in-time organization)

Now, when you are working on a project or area of your life, open up your PARA system to see if there is existing content waiting for you 👀

This system has literally changed my digital life. I am no longer a hoarder of information.

Instead, I actively can work towards my goals while referencing and recalling content that "old me" saved to be useful and actionable.

I highly recommend giving it a try and letting your knowledge base grow organically 🌱 around your own goals and projects.

### TL;DR

PARA is a method by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) for organizing digital information by **actionability**.

It stands for:
1. ✅ **Projects** - short term efforts with a deadline
2. 🔭 **Areas** - long term personal responsibilities
3. 📚 **Resources** - topics or interests for generally useful info
4. 🗃️ **Archives** - inactive or completed items

Get started:
1. Choose an app to organize and take notes.
2. Set up folders for the 4 main categories, then add and manage content as you go.
3. As you work, reference notes by opening the project or area you are working on.
4. Benefit! 💪
