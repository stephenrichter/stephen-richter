You’re not richer than you think.

Personal finances can be a touchy subject for the majority of families and couples. (Insert stat). You are not richer than you think. You probably have an accurate perspective on the amount of income you receive from your work. And There is no magic solution or “life-hack” that will make you a great deal richer.

However, the amount of individuals and couples who do not have an accurate depiction of where and how their money is being spent, and what financial priorities are important in their lives is staggering. (Stat).

I’ve seen and used a number of finance apps that help automatically roll your finances into categories, which then give you a “general summary” of where your money is going. And while I credit these apps with bringing financials in an easy-to-consume format for us regular humans, I believe it should be taken one step further. It doesn’t take much time to go in detail, painstaking detail, line by line through 15-30 days of credit card expenses.

Degrees of separation, credit cards, apps, etc.

That’s why my fiancée and I sit down every 15 days to review or budget and expenses, as well as savings goals. Here’s our process:

Download .csv and review/categorize items
This is an important first step, and the most painful part of the process. It involves going through our credit card statements line by line and reviewing the individual items we spent money on. I have to admit at first this created some small arguments and maybe some tears.. but the main point here is to come to the table with no judgement.

As you continue this habit, it becomes more natural. The key is to have discussions up front and set expectations so that you avoid large arguments at the end of the month when all your income has been spent at Aritzia or a night out drinking with the guys.

Income and Expenses added to budget sheet - holy shit we spend a lot on food
Now that you’ve categorized your expenses it’s time to add them to your monthly budget. This is where you begin to see how little items add up to a large expense at the end of each month.

For example, we like to eat.. but until you see how a couple of Starbucks sandwiches here and there add to our $800 food bill, it doesn’t seem possible.

Again, there’s nothing wrong with this.. as long as you are aware. Once you can see this, you can make adjustments that fit your own lifestyle. The mistake is in not knowing in the first place, and then complaining that you “can’t afford” to do something. You can, it’s just not what you have made a priority.

Savings Buckets
This is the most fun part of the process. Every 2 weeks we discuss and prioritize where our savings $$ should be going. Need a new iPhone? Raise the priority. Etc.

Essentially, our “spending money” for the next 15 days is whatever is left after our net zero.. that is, bank account - credit cards - savings buckets.

Really it’s no different than how we were taught as kids. Each time grandma gave me $2 in a birthday card, that money would go into a piggy bank until I had enough to buy Zelda for my Nintendo GameBoy. When have us the right to dismiss those fundamentals just because we started making more money? Those habits should still apply!

As we grow as a family, our priorities will shift and this strategy encourages that. The most important thing is it is always a constant “boring discussion” as opposed to a painful discussion in 2 years when we realize we are in debt from our wedding or don’t have the money to fix a broken vehicle or pay for a spontaneous getaway.

Final Thoughts
Everybody is different. This is just one way of organizing personal or joint finances. We’ve also had separate finances with our own spending money so we are free to do whatever we want.. this also worked. However, as we get closer to starting a family of our own, we find this is a good exercise and improves communication in our relationship!

I’d love to hear your workflows for personal finance!
