Google Analytics is a powerful tool that so often I see being misused or mistreated. For some marketers or business owners, having a Google Analytics Tag installed on their website is about the extent to which “they use Google Analytics”. In this article we dive into how to Setup GA to work for you, as you continuously improve your content, website, and digital marketing strategy.

Step 1 - install google analytics
If you already have GA installed on your site, and you are able to access that property, you can skip this step. If you don’t, let’s get started!

Create your Google Account (google drive)
Create a new GA Property, name it
Tracking Code install in HTML head (optional: google tag manager)

Step 2 - block out spam and internal ips
Once you have data coming in to your website, you may start to get excited, especially if you are just starting out. “Look! 125 views on my website everyday!” That’s great Jamie, however the top 3 people viewing your site at this point are most likely: you, your mom, and Russian or Chinese bots looking for your email address so they can spam you with discount offers on cement mix.

Although it can be depressing to see your site visits drop from 125 to 23 a day.. your business will thank you. Let’s see how we can block out spam to get more accurate data.

Set up spam filters
Set up internal IP filters

Step 3 - set up conversions and goals
That’s great! We’ve got accurate data coming into our analytics and we can begin to see some useful information about our customers (demographics, interests, mobile, geography). But how does all this tie into sales and our business goals?

This is one of, if not the, most important step. How do we know if our visitors are engaging with our business goals? This could be a sale of a product, submitting an application form, contacting our office, or just viewing a specific piece of content.

Thankfully, GA allows us to set up Goals and track Conversions. It’s very simple to set up basic goals, but also allows the analytics nerds to set up some really complex and specific goals as well.

Set up a contact form goal
Set up an application form goal

Step 4 - track campaigns and content
Okay! We’ve got accurate data coming in, and goals set up so we know where these people go and whether or not they interact with our business objectives. Now let’s find out where the come from.. and cross our fingers that a good portion is from our awesome marketing efforts!

Review Acquisition data and breakdown
Set up organic campaign tracking
Demonstrate a Paid Campaign

Step 5 - continuous improvement
The key to leveraging all the fancy data we now have is to constantly be adjusting our strategies based on evidence.

Weekly or monthly review of KPIs (google dashboard)
Adjusting our website, content, and campaigns - lessons learned
None of this replaces customer relationships!!

Best of luck! Did I miss anything?
